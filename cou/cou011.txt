Touko: Hello, Lain.

Lain: <(in a soft voice)> Hello.

Touko:
Hmm. You don't sound so energetic. Maybe you
don't feel up for this. Why don't we quit now?
Ok? But since you came all the way out here,
how would you like a cup of tea or something?
What would you like? Don't be shy.

Lain: I want to talk.

Touko: You don't have to force yourself. That might
make you fell even worse. Take my word for it.

Lain: I want to be cured.

Touko: Cured... but you're not sick, Lain.

Lain: But this is a hospital isn't it?

Touko:
Well, this place can function as a hospital,
but I see patients at my research room as well.
Right now, I don't know if you are really sick
sick, Lain. Still, if you aren't feeling well
ir are worried about something, I'd like to be
able to help you.

Lain: I'm not sick?

Touko:
Right now, I'm not completely sure, but you're
proably just fine. Even if you are sick, I'll
make sure that you are cured.

Lain: You're absolutely sure you can cure me?

Touko: Absolutely. I will not let you be sick.

Lain: Sense, why are you so kind me? Is it
because it is you job?

Touko:
Hmm... You're right that this is a part if my
work. But it's a type if work that's hard to
see as just work. Most of the time, I see
patientsm, diagnose them as objectively as
possible, and give them psychological
treatment, but it isn't enough to make them
better. I'm a researcher as well as a docker.
If I see someone suffering, I must try and help
that person. I want to do everything I can to
help that person.

Lain: You would do that for anybody?

Touko:
To be specific, if I see someone suffering from
something for which the cause is physical and
obvious, I refer that person to a specialist.
If there is a car accident or a poisoning,
that's what I would do. Do put it simply, I'm
not the kind of docker who treats people who
have something wrong with them physically.

Lain: So I have...

柊子：你好，莱茵。

铃音：（轻声）你好。

柊子：
嗯。你听起来没什么精神。也许你不太想做这个。要不我们现在就打住吧？怎么样？不过既然你大老远跑来了，要不要来杯茶或者别的什么？你想喝点什么？别不好意思。

铃音：我想谈谈。

东子：你不必勉强自己。那样可能会让你感觉更糟。相信我。

铃音：我想被治愈。

柊子：治愈了……但你没病，铃音。

铃音：但这是一家医院，不是吗？

柊子：
嗯，这里可以当作医院来用，
不过我也在我的研究室给病人看病。
现在，我不知道你是不是真的生病了，
铃音。不过，如果你身体不舒服
或者有什么烦心事，我希望我能
帮到你。

铃音：我没生病？

柊子：
现在我还不完全确定，但你大概只是有点小毛病。就算你真的生病了，我也会确保你痊愈的。

铃音：你绝对肯定能治好我？

东子：当然。我不会让你生病的。

铃音：森斯，你为什么对我这么好？是因为这是你的工作吗？

东子：
嗯……你说得没错，这是我的工作的一部分。但这种工作很难单纯地只看作是工作。大多数时候，我给病人看病，尽可能客观地诊断病情，并给予心理治疗，但这还不足以让他们康复。我既是研究者也是医生。如果我看到有人受苦，我必须尽力帮助那个人。我想尽我所能去帮助那个人。

铃音：你会为任何人那样做吗？

柊子：
具体来说，如果我看到有人因身体上的明显原因而痛苦，我会把那个人转介给专科医生。比如发生车祸或者中毒的情况，我就会这么做。简单来说，我不是那种治疗身体有毛病的人的医生。

铃音：所以我有……
