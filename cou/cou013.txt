Lain: Hello, Touko-san.

Touko:
Hello, Lain. OPk, from today we're going to
really tackle what's bothering you, Lain-chan.
I'm sorry. I mean Lain. We're going to try to
figure things out so you don't see nightmares
anymore.

Lain:
Un, huh. I haven't seen nightmares much lately,
though. Someimes I hear things, though.

Touko: Hear things? Like what?

Lain:
I don't know. It sounds like someone talking. I
don't like hearing it, so I try my best to
ignore it.

Touko:
Hmm. Do you know whose voice you hear?

Lain:
I don't know. It can be a man's voice ir a
woman's voice.

Touko:
Where do the voices seem to come from?

Lain: From the sky.

Touko: The sky? From what part of the sky?

Lain: From electric lines. Somehow...

Touko:
The electric lines... Do you know what's in
side of electric lines?

Lain: Wiring that carries electricity.

Touko: 
Right. They carry electricity that comes form
power plants. Do feel like you sense electricity?

Lain:
I don't really know. Sometimes it seems to come
from the sky; not the electric lines.

Touko:
Are you bothered by it right now?

Lain:
