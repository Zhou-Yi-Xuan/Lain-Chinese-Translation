Lain: Are there different kinds of milk as well?

Touko: That's right; although they're basically all
they same, depending on how they're prepared
there are different kinds.

Lain: Different kinds?

Touko: Yes, in tea too. Depending on the way the
leaves are dried and the way the tea is poured,
the same leaves can be very different.

Lain: People too?

Touko: Hmm?

Lain: Are there different kinds of people as wall?

Touko:
Hmm, well, rather than kinds, each person is
different in his or her own way, For example,
you don't like tea, but there are also people is
like me who love it. There are also people
whose stomach gets upset when they drink milk,
but there also those whose stomach doesn't get
when they grow up, learn to drink it. Lain,
you'll probably will learn to drink tea you
know. It's not a good thing, nor a bad thing
It's normal that there are different kinds of
people. That's why you can just ignore rather
you should be proud of your uniqueness Y think!

Lain: Be proud if it?

Touko:
I'm sorry... That's right, you worry, don't
you? You don't have to boast about it, but
there's no need to mind what other people think
is what I meant to say.

Lain:
I have weird dreams, it that different too?

Touko:
You may think its different, but in fact that's
normal. If you're worried about that, I might
ba able to help. Not to help you stop having
those dreams, but rather helping you to explain
things you don't understand. If you come to me
with your problems, I'd be really happy. You
those kinds of questions; I'm still studing
actually. If you're ever in trounble or
something, and should you want to come and talk
to me, that'd be OK. I'd like to know mroe
about you Lain. Would that be OK?
I'm so glad! Starting today you and I are
friends! Please come and play sometime!
Promise?

Lain: I'd like to ask you things as well!

Touko:
You can ask me anything you want. If I don't
know the answer I'll look up the answer for
you. I'll even prepare your favorite drink.

Lain: What's that??

Touko: Milk that doesn't upset your stomach!

铃音：也有不同种类的牛奶吗？

柊子：没错；虽然它们本质上都差不多，但根据烹饪方式的不同，种类也有所区别。

铃音：不同的种类？

柊子：没错，茶也一样。同样的茶叶，根据干燥方式的不同以及冲泡方式的不同，味道也会大相径庭。

铃音：人也一样？

柊子：嗯？

铃音：墙上也有不同种类的人吗？

柊子：
嗯，好吧，与其说是种类，不如说每个人都有自己独特的地方。
比如，你不喜欢茶，但也有像我这样喜欢茶的人。还有人喝牛奶会肚子不舒服，
但也有人长大后学会喝牛奶就不会了。铃音，你以后可能也会学会喝茶的，你知道的。
这既不是好事也不是坏事，人与人不同是很正常的。
所以你不必在意，反而应该为自己的独特感到骄傲，我觉得！

铃音：为此感到骄傲？

柊子：
对不起……没错，你在担心，对吧？你不必为此吹嘘，但我的意思是，你也不必在意别人怎么想。

铃音：
我做奇怪的梦，这也很奇怪吗？

东子：
你可能觉得这不一样，但实际上这是正常的。如果你为此担心，或许我能帮上忙。
不是帮你不再做那样的梦，而是帮你解释你不明白的事情。
如果你带着你的问题来找我，我会非常高兴。你有那些问题，其实我还在学习呢。
如果你遇到麻烦或者什么的，想来找我聊聊，那没问题。我想多了解了解你，Lain，可以吗？
太好了！从今天起你和我就是朋友了！有空来玩玩吧！答应我？

铃音：我也想问你一些事情！

柊子：
你想问什么都可以。如果我不知道答案，我会帮你查一下。我甚至会给你准备你最喜欢的饮料。

铃音：那是什么？

柊子：不会让你肚子不舒服的牛奶！
