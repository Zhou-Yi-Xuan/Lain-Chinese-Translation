Lain: It's because I'm weird...

Touko:
Wait a second Lain. You're not a weird kid at
all. Everone thinks they're weird when they're
kids. <don't understand this sentence>

Lain: But you're wrong.

Touko: Do you dislike being different from others?

Lain: I'm not sure

Touko:
Okay? Lain is Lain because she is different.
You have very strong imagination, and that's
don't think that at all.

Lain: But... the test... <referring to test she did in the past>

Touko:
I'm sorry... but you're ttroubled, right? I want
you to not to be troubled. In other to help
you, I have to know more about you. I don't
want to make you uncomfortable.

Lain: What should I do?

Touko:
Right now you don't need to do anything. Since
you and I are friends, if we keep talking, I'll
slowly start to understand more and more about
you. So, if I say, "I think you should come
over," it would br good for you to think, "That
sounds nice, okay." <really stranges sentence here> So Right
now, it'd be best if you tell me all about yourself

Lain: You won't tell anyone?

Touko: Nope, it'll be our secret.

Lain: Not even your friends, or your mother?

Touko: I promise. If I lie, one thousand needles!

Lain: One thousand needles?

Touko: Don't kids your age know that? When I was a
kid. whenever we made a promise, we said, "If I
break the promise, I will drink 1000 needles."

Lain: Wouldn't that hurt?

Touko:
A lot!! <don't know this sentence yet> Right! How many
needles are in my stomach right now? MIss
Iwakura? <talking like a teacher>

Lain: ... five thousand?

Touko:
Wrong! Yesterdy. since I went to the bathroom
and flushed everything out, there's zeor!

Lain: Sense. that's gross! <note that's the doctor's sensei, not
teacher's sensei. I don't think "Touko" or "You" would fit as nicely>

Touko: <lanugh>
