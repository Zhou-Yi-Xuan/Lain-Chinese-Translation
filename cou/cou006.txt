Touko: Hello Lain, have you been well?

Lain: You, and you?

Touko: Yes, I've been fine. I'm a bit tired though.

Lain: Tired?

Touko: Yes, I've been pretty busy.

Lain: With what?

Touko:
Hmm, well... At least talking with you like this is something
I can look forward to.

Lain: Really?

Touko:
Really! What shall we talk about today... What
do you want to talk about Lain?

Lain:
I want to talk about you, docker. We weren't able to last month.

Touko:
I'd rather talk about you, Lain; not about
myself, though. But you're right, it's only
fair that we both get to talk about what we
want, so this time we'll talk about me, but
next time we'll talk about you Lain. is that
all right?

Lain: OK!

Touko:
I'm not sure where I should start though... My
name is Younara Touk, I'm 27, I'm a docker at
the Tokyo Research Instiute for
Psychotherapy... That's this place. Ah, we
won't get answhere like this. You know, I'm
used to listning pepole talk, not used to
talking myself. Is there anything you'd like to
know Lain?

Lain: How did you become a docker?

Tokyo:
I studied a lot at a place called a university.
I wrote something called a thesis, and with
that I reveived my degree to become a docker.

柊子：嗨，铃音，你最近好吗？

铃音：你呢，还有你？

柊子：是的，我一直挺好的。不过有点累。

铃音：累了吗？

柊子：是的，我一直挺忙的。

铃音：与什么？

柊子：
嗯，好吧…… 至少像这样和你聊天是我能期待的事。

铃音：真的吗？

柊子：
真的！那我们今天聊什么呢…… 你想聊什么，铃音？

铃音：
我想谈谈你，多克尔。上个月我们没能谈成。

柊子：
我更愿意聊聊你，铃音；不过不是说我自己。不过你说得对，公平起见，
咱们俩都该能说说各自想说的，所以这次我来说说我自己，下次咱们再聊聊你，
铃音，这样可以吗？

铃音：好的！

柊子：
不过我真不知道该从哪儿说起…… 我叫米良柊子，27 岁，
在东京心理治疗研究所当医生……就是这儿。啊，这样下去可不行。
你知道的，我习惯听别人说话，不习惯自己开口。铃音，你有什么想了解的吗？

铃音：你是怎么成为一名医生的？

柊子：
我在一个叫大学的地方学习了很多。
我写了一篇叫论文的东西，凭借它我获得了学位，成为了一名医生。
